Below are some clarification for function calls and what different files do

1. 	create_migsig.m and computeMicSig.m

	Depending on the situation (of whether or not the mic signals need to be considered separately or together), create_micsig.m calls either (i) computeMicSig.m or (ii) computeMicSig_separateSources. 

	Note: Throughout our code, we use the function "computeMicSig.m" to compute the microphone signal because "create_micsig.m" additionally plots the signal, saves the mic signal as a .mat file, and plays back the signal

2.  MUSIC_wideband.m and MUSIC_pseudoSpectrum_singFreq()

	MUSIC_wideband.m calls the function file MUSIC_pseudoSpectrum_singFreq()
	
	Note: MUSIC_pseudoSpectrum_singFreq() creates the pseudo spectrum of a single frequency. It takes in the STFT and the PSD data and outputs the psuedo spectrum for that frequency.
